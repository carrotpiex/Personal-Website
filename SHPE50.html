									<p style="font-size: 24px">Attending the 50th Year Celebration of SHPE was a memorable milestone in my journey as a student. This event marked my first professional conference, and it was an inspiring experience to be surrounded by so many talented people who shared a passion for engineering and technology. Going into the conference, I was excited to learn, connect, and understand what it means to be part of this vibrant and supportive community.</p>
									<p style="font-size: 24px">One of the most impactful lessons I took away from the event was the importance of building an authentic personal brand. Across the workshops and panels I attended, multiple professionals emphasized that while technical skills are crucial, what truly makes a difference in the workplace is being reliable, ethical, and staying true to yourself. This message resonated with me and made me reflect on how I approach my career planning and interactions with others. It is not just about excelling technically but also about being a person others can trust and respect.</p>
									<p style="font-size: 24px">Another highlight of the conference was the opportunity to engage with company representatives and learn about various career paths within computer science. For the first time, I stepped out of my comfort zone to network, ask questions, and talk about my goals. These conversations not only gave me insights into different roles, such as software engineering, cybersecurity, and data analysis, but also helped me secure a few interviews. This experience taught me the value of putting myself out there and being proactive in seeking opportunities.</p>
									<p style="font-size: 24px">The sense of community at the SHPE conference was something I will never forget. I met students, mentors, and professionals who inspired me with their stories and offered valuable advice. Building these connections made me realize how important it is to have a strong network of people who encourage and support you. Many of the relationships I formed during the event have already proven to be meaningful, and I look forward to nurturing them as I grow in my career. This conference was more than just a professional development opportunity. It was a celebration of culture, achievement, and shared goals within the Hispanic engineering community. I left the event feeling more motivated and confident in my ability to succeed in this field.</p>
