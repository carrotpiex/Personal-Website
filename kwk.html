									<p style="font-size: 24px">During my senior year of high school, I had the opportunity to attend the Kode With Klossy Code-A-Bration event, and it completely changed my perspective on coding. It was a big reason why I chose to pursue a major in Computer Science and Engineering. I had a blast learning the basics of coding, including HTML, CSS, and Swift, but what stuck with me was the atmosphere. The event felt incredibly welcoming, a space where anyone, no matter their background, could jump into tech and feel comfortable.</p>
									<p style="font-size: 24px">What made the event even more special was the chance to connect with so many amazing women who were just as passionate about technology. The speakers and mentors shared their personal stories of breaking into the industry, and their experiences were inspiring. Being surrounded by so many talented women, especially those who were pushing boundaries in tech, motivated me to keep learning. The whole experience made me realize that tech is about more than just coding, it's about creativity, problem-solving, and building a community. That excitement and sense of connection are what solidified my decision to pursue a future in computer science.</p>
